## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run fast tests only (excludes slow tests)
python run_tests.py fast

# Run with coverage report
python run_tests.py --coverage

# Run specific test categories
python run_tests.py unit
python run_tests.py integration

# Run specific test file
python run_tests.py --specific tests/test_database.py
```

### Direct pytest Usage
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_database.py

# Run specific test method
pytest tests/test_database.py::TestDatabase::test_mark_image_for_removal

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- **Database Tests**: CRUD operations, removal marking, protection, statistics
- **File Manager Tests**: File operations, database-driven removal, dry-run mode
- **Image Scanner Tests**: Directory traversal, file detection, @eaDir skipping
- **Duplicate Detector Tests**: Group creation, keeper selection, duplicate logic
- **Main Application Tests**: Argument parsing, mode handling, validation

### Integration Tests
- **Complete Workflow Tests**: Full detect → protect → remove workflows
- **CLI Integration**: Command-line interface testing with subprocesses
- **Database Persistence**: Multi-run database consistency
- **Error Handling**: Edge cases and error conditions

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage includes:

### Core Functionality ✅
- [x] Mode-based operation (detect, remove, protect)
- [x] Database-driven removal workflow
- [x] Image protection system
- [x] @eaDir directory skipping
- [x] CSV report generation
- [x] Dry-run functionality
- [x] Error handling and validation

### Database Operations ✅
- [x] Image metadata storage and retrieval
- [x] Marking images for removal
- [x] Protecting images from deletion
- [x] Duplicate group management
- [x] Database statistics and queries

### File Operations ✅
- [x] Database-driven file removal
- [x] File existence and permission checking
- [x] Dry-run simulation
- [x] Backup script generation

### Image Processing ✅
- [x] Directory scanning and traversal
- [x] Image file detection
- [x] System directory skipping
- [x] Symlink handling
- [x] Permission error handling

### Application Modes ✅
- [x] Detect mode: scan, detect, mark for removal
- [x] Remove mode: query database, confirm, remove files
- [x] Protect mode: mark images as protected
- [x] Argument validation for all modes

## Key Test Features

### Comprehensive Fixtures
- Temporary directories and databases
- Sample image creation and metadata
- Mock file operations for safety
- Populated test databases

### Safety Measures
- All file operations use temporary directories
- Mock file deletion prevents accidental data loss
- Database operations use in-memory or temporary databases
- Proper cleanup after each test

### Performance Testing
- Multi-threaded scanning tests
- Large dataset simulation (marked as slow)
- Memory usage validation
- Database query performance

### Error Condition Testing
- Permission denied scenarios
- Corrupted database handling
- Non-existent file/directory handling
- Invalid argument combinations

## Adding New Tests

### Test File Template
```python
"""
Tests for new functionality.
"""

import pytest
from pathlib import Path

class TestNewFeature:
    """Test cases for new feature."""
    
    def test_basic_functionality(self, temp_dir, memory_db):
        """Test basic functionality."""
        # Arrange
        # Act
        # Assert
        pass
    
    @pytest.mark.slow
    def test_performance(self):
        """Test performance with large datasets."""
        pass
    
    @pytest.mark.integration
    def test_integration_workflow(self):
        """Test integration with other components."""
        pass
```

### Best Practices
1. Use descriptive test names
2. Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
3. Use appropriate fixtures for setup
4. Mark slow tests with `@pytest.mark.slow`
5. Mark integration tests with `@pytest.mark.integration`
6. Mock external dependencies
7. Test both success and failure cases
8. Use temporary files/directories for safety

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to be CI-friendly:
- Fast test subset for quick feedback
- Deterministic test results
- Proper cleanup and isolation
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Coverage tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Errors**: Tests use temporary directories with full permissions
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Install with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
3. **Slow Tests**: Use `python run_tests.py fast` to skip slow tests
4. **Mock Issues**: Some tests mock file operations for safety

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with debug output
pytest -v -s

# Run specific failing test
pytest tests/test_file.py::TestClass::test_method -v -s

# Show test output
pytest --capture=no
```
